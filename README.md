Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection Using Deep Learning
This project focuses on the early diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using a supervised deep learning approach, leveraging behavioral features and individual characteristics. Early diagnosis of ASD is critical for timely intervention, as it can enhance treatment effectiveness and reduce long-term healthcare costs.

Project Overview
Objective: Develop and deploy a neural network to screen for ASD in children, based on a dataset of behavioral and demographic information.
Dataset: Utilizes the Autistic Spectrum Disorder Screening Data for Children dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains screening data for 292 patients. Dataset link.
Modeling Framework: Implements a neural network using Keras, a high-level API for building and training deep learning models.
Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Includes steps to clean and prepare the dataset, ensuring that the features are suitable for neural network input.
Neural Network Architecture: Designed a custom neural network architecture to classify individuals based on ASD likelihood, focusing on accuracy and reliability.
Model Training: Trains the model using Keras, leveraging supervised learning techniques to detect ASD-related patterns from the input features.
Evaluation: Measures model performance using accuracy and other classification metrics to ensure robust predictions.
Getting Started
This repository contains all the necessary code to preprocess data, train the neural network, and evaluate its performance on ASD detection tasks.
